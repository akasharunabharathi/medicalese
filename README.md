# Medicalese
Ever felt confused by all the big words on the report from your blood tests? Wished someone would interpret those mysterious numbers and let you know if you're normal ASAP? Here's Medicalese â€“ one tool to simplify it all for you! Upload snapshots of your reports, and receive super easy-to-understand explanations.

## Subsystems:

As of now, there are two primary subsystems to this project, (listed in the order that they process user input):

The OCR-Summarization Subsystem: This is responsible for recognising the text from the reports (contains report text, details of patient's lab work, measurements of blood markers for various functions, etc) that users pass in, and summarizing the report. This is also the first layer where we encounter user input for processing. Uses the Tesseract-OCR engine and Falaconsai's Medical Summarization Model.

The Explainer Subsytem: Takes the input from the OCR-Summarization engine and simplifies it down for users. Yay! Uses Llama-3.
